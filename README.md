# How i Approached the task

First off, I choose a framework which was vite.js and then i thought what libraries and tools can be used in this project?
I was searching for a free maps library, I found some of them and some are paid for which the task can be fullfiled with, but yeah i needed a free library, after searching i decided to go with Leaflet Library. but the big question for me was how'd i create this bubbles or hexagon on the map. The library which was offering this feature was Deck.gl. but it was paid, I still tried so find a free one, after some time i decided to do the bubble effect on the leaflet library only their was just bubble effect so i picked it.
rest of the project was based on Representaional Data. Then i searched for CharBar Library, and so on. Hence the project was created.

# Note

This is not fully responsive build as it was not mentioned in the notes. though on the computer it works fine.
